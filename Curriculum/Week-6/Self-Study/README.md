## 🎯 How to Use These Materials

1. **Read sequentially** — Start with DOM Manipulation, then Events, then the others
2. **Code along** — Type every example yourself; don't just read
3. **Complete the exercises** — Each document has practice challenges at the end
4. **Build something** — After all 5 documents, build a small project combining these concepts
5. **Refer to MDN** — When you need deeper detail, visit [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
